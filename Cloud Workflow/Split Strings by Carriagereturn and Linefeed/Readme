When working with strings that contain carriage return (\r) and line feed (\n) characters in Power Automate, 
a direct approach using split() with \r or \r\n as delimiters might not work as expected. 

you should use decodeUriComponent('%0D') to process \r
you should use decodeUriComponent('%0A') to process \n

To effectively split multi-line strings into an array, you can use a two-step process involving string replacement and splitting.

Steps to Split Multi-Line Strings:

1. Replace Carriage Returns:

Replace all occurrences of the carriage return character (\r) with an empty string. 
This step removes the carriage return characters from your string, leaving only the line feed characters (\n) as delimiters for new lines.

expression:
replace(variables('StringContent'), decodeUriComponent('%0D'),'')

2. Split Using Line Feeds: 

expression:
split(replace(variables('StringContent'), decodeUriComponent('%0D'),''), decodeUriComponent('%0A'))
