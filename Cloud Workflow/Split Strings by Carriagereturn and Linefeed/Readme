### Splitting Strings with Carriage Return and Line Feed Characters in Power Automate

When working with strings that contain carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`) characters in Power Automate, a direct approach using `split()` with `\r` or `\r\n` as delimiters might not work as expected. To effectively split multi-line strings into an array, you can use a two-step process involving string replacement and splitting.

#### Steps to Split Multi-Line Strings:

1. **Replace Carriage Returns**: Replace all occurrences of the carriage return character (`\r`) with an empty string. This step removes the carriage return characters from your string, leaving only the line feed characters (`\n`) as delimiters for new lines.

2. **Split Using Line Feeds**: Once the carriage returns are removed, split the string at each line feed character (`\n`). This step divides the string into an array of strings, each representing a line from the original string.

#### Expression to Use in Power Automate:

Assuming you have a variable named `StringContent` that contains the multi-line string, use the following expression to perform the above steps:

```plaintext
split(replace(variables('StringContent'), decodeUriComponent('%0D'), ''), decodeUriComponent('%0A'))
